   - **Handling Missing Data**: Identify and fill or remove missing values to ensure data integrity.
   - **Data Transformation**: Convert data into appropriate formats for analysis, such as parsing dates or standardizing categorical variables.

### 2. Data Reshaping and Aggregation
   - **Pivot Tables**: Use pivot tables to summarize data, facilitating the calculation of key performance indicators (KPIs).
   - **Grouping Data**: Group data by specific attributes (e.g., product categories) to perform aggregated calculations like total sales or average discounts.

### 3. KPI Calculation and Insight Generation:
   - **Sales Metrics**: Compute metrics such as total revenue, average order value, and sales growth rates.
   - **Customer Analysis**: Analyze customer data to determine metrics like repeat purchase rate or customer lifetime value.

### 4.Data Pipeline Development and Export:
   - **Automated Data Processing**: Create scripts to automate data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) processes.
   - **Exporting Results**: Utilize libraries like openpyxl to export processed data and analysis results to Excel for reporting purposes.
